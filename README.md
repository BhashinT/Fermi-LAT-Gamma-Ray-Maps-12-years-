# Fermi-LAT-Gamma-Ray-Maps-12-years-
The files provided within this repository contain the Fermi-LAT Gamma-Ray maps used in the cross-correlation analysis performed by Thakore et. al. (2025) between the tangential shear obtained from the DES Y3 survey and the 12-year gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10506). The zip files contain the gamma-ray maps with the NSIDE used in the analysis (1024). The details regarding the generation of the gamma-ray maps have been provided in the aforementioned paper. Each .zip file contains a map relating to one of the nine energy bins detailed in the paper (and generated from 100 micro, logarithmically spaced bins between 100 MeV and 1 TeV), with the gamma-ray energy range split between 631 MeV to 1 TeV. The indices in the filenames range from 0 to 8 and correlate to each energy bin as follows:
- Index 0 : 631 MeV to 1.202 GeV
- Index 1 : 1.202 GeV to 2.290 GeV
- Index 2 : 2.290 GeV to 4.786 GeV
- Index 3 : 4.786 GeV to 9.12 GeV
- Index 4 : 9.12 GeV to 17.38 GeV
- Index 5 : 17.38 GeV to 36.31 GeV
- Index 6 : 36.31 GeV to 69.18 GeV
- Index 7 : 69.18 GeV to 131.8 Gev
- Index 8 : 131.8 GeV to 1.00 TeV
