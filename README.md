# Fermi-LAT-Gamma-Ray-Maps-12-years-
The files provided within this repository contain the Fermi-LAT Gamma-Ray maps used in the cross-correlation analysis performed by Thakore et. al. between the tangential shear obtained from the DES Y3 survey and the 12-year gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10506). The zip files contain the gamma-ray maps with the NSIDE used in the analysis (1024). The details regarding the generation of the gamma-ray maps have been provided in the aforementioned paper.
